# Vir-Motus
Bike rental site.

Requirements for the website:

    You have the option to use any technologies available to you, or simple HTML, CSS, and JS.

    The system should be able to validate the userâ€™s selection.
	What does this mean? A confirmation box? Looking in the json for the option selected? The latter seems to make sense except I wouldn't be building something that would even display something that wasn't in the json.

    The content displayed should be responsive for mobile and desktop.

    Provide access to the see the code and a link to see the page working.

    It should not take more than 2 hours to complete.

    Please return your test within 7 days of this email (18 Sept. 2019).

I have to use the provided .json.

They didn't provide a ton of instruction on how in depth to go, besides taking about two hours, so I think I'll showcase some of my business and design skills.
Not sure how I want to play this marketing-wise. My initial thought was that cycling the demographics of cyclists would be largely upper-middle class women in the 30-50 range staing in shape (because that describes my sister and the people she rides with, and consequently the only people I ever actually ride with.) Consequenstly, I was going to approaching a branding strategy of focusing on the physicality, the aggressiveness, the thrill, the danger, and so on and try to hit men in the 25-50 range as an untapped market. The message to convey would be that driving a car, riding a motorcycle, these are things out of shape, lazy, weak people do. You ride a bike, you move by your own power. Because you're a man. (Cue the "Now You're a Man" song by Orgazmo.) But... a short search of some demographics indicate that my perception was wrong and that men ride in much higher numbers than women. The rub is that that same research indicated that what women are looking for is safety, primarily, and I'm not sure how to market that with the given product list.

Or maybe I stop worrying about marketing and just do the task given to me. Either way, that's the story of how I came up with the name for this repository.
